### Containernet: Mininet fork that allows to use Docker containers as hosts in emulated networks

This fork of Mininet allows to use Docker containers as Mininet hosts. This enables interesting functionalities to built networking/cloud testbeds. The integration is done by subclassing the original Host class.

Based on: Mininet 2.2.1

### NFV multi-PoP Extension

There is an extension of Containernet called [son-emu](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu) which is a full-featured multi-PoP emulation platform for NFV scenarios which is developed as part of the [SONATA](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu) project.

### Features

* Add, remove Docker containers to Mininet topologies
* Connect Docker containers to topology (to switches, other containers, or legacy Mininet hosts)
* Execute commands inside Docker containers by using the Mininet CLI 
* Dynamic topology changes (lets behave like a small cloud ;-))
   * Add Hosts/Docker containers to a *running* Mininet topology
   * Connect Hosts/Docker containers to a *running* Mininet topology
   * Remove Hosts/Docker containers/Links from a *running* Mininet topology
* Resource limitation of Docker containers
   * CPU limitation with Docker CPU share option
   * CPU limitation with Docker CFS period/quota options
   * Memory/swap limitation
   * Change CPU/mem limitations at runtime!
* Traffic control links (delay, bw, loss, jitter)
   * (missing: TCLink support for dynamically added containers/hosts)
* Automated unit tests for all new features
* Automated installation based on Ansible playbook

### Installation
Containernet comes with three installation and deployment options.

#### Option 1: Bare-metal installation
Automatic installation is provided through an Ansible playbook.
* Requires: Ubuntu **16.04 LTS**

```bash
sudo apt-get install ansible git aptitude
git clone https://github.com/containernet/containernet.git
cd containernet/ansible
sudo ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local install.yml
```
Wait (and have a coffee) ...

#### Option 2: Nested Docker deployment
Containernet can be executed within a privileged Docker container (nested container deployment). There is also a pre-build Docker image available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/containernet/containernet/).

```bash
# build the container locally
docker build -t containernet .
```

```bash
# or pull the latest pre-build container
docker pull containernet/containernet
```

```bash
# run the container
docker run --name containernet -it --rm --privileged --pid='host' -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containernet /bin/bash
```

#### Option 3: Vagrant-based VM creation
##### There are to diffrent ways to use Vagrant.
##### 1. in the Containernet directory
If you run:
```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
in the cloned repository. You will get a VM that has the full directory structure sync with 
`
/home/ubuntu/containernet
`
If you want to contribute to the Containernet project. This is probably what you want.

#### 2. in a seprate directory
If you want to use Containernet as a dependancy in your own project. You can use:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containernet/containernet/master/StandaloneVagrantfile -o Vagrantfile
```
to download the `StandaloneVagrantfile`, which is automatically renamed to `Vagrantfile` by the curl command. This `Vagrantfile` will download all nessarry parts needed to get up and running. This means your project structure stays slim.

To start the VM just run
```bash
vagrant up
```
After the VM has started, you can use:
```bash
vagrant ssh
```
to login as `root`. This is needed because mininet needs full access. If you use PyCharm Professional you can use the created VM as a remote interpreter.
### Usage / Run
Start example topology with some empty Docker containers connected to the network.

* `cd containernet`
* run: `sudo python examples/containernet_example.py`
* use: `containernet> d1 ifconfig` to see config of container d1

### Topology example

In your custom topology script you can add Docker hosts as follows:

```python

info('*** Adding docker containers\n')
d1 = net.addDocker('d1', ip='10.0.0.251', dimage="ubuntu:trusty")
d2 = net.addDocker('d2', ip='10.0.0.252', dimage="ubuntu:trusty", cpu_period=50000, cpu_quota=25000)
d3 = net.addHost('d3', ip='11.0.0.253', cls=Docker, dimage="ubuntu:trusty", cpu_shares=20)
d4 = net.addDocker('d4', dimage="ubuntu:trusty", volumes=["/:/mnt/vol1:rw"])

```

### Tests
There is a set of Containernet specific unit tests located in `mininet/test/test_containernet.py`. To run these, do:

* `sudo py.test -v mininet/test/test_containernet.py`
